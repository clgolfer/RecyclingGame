Pick which parts you want to work on and push up to the git
Parts that need worked on:

Implementing the graphics:
    This would involve getting all the image files and pasting them ontop of the objects that we are using to track
Inputs:
    For specifically testing use keyboard to activate switches, when we get touchpad update these keys to work with touchscreen.
    This also involves moving the switches on screen
Object Termination/Generation:
    Being able to create the object and then track when the objects get the the final destination points.
    Assigning points if its a proper score
Object Movement: -- Joseph
    As of how I have it set up now, objects are moving along a certain track.  There is a set number of tracks and depending on input will determine
    which way objects should travel.  This need to modify the object movement between points as well as calculation for the specific points.
Score/Next Object:
    This is the secondary on screen inputs.  Score is handled for the most part but it still needs to find a home that will work.  We also need to blitz
    the next object that is going to be generated to the screen so the users can see whats comming up next.  This needs to work with the object generation
    so that you do that random gen side for determining what object type it will be where the attributes for that object are assigned with the generator.
Start/Objects Left/Game Over:
    The is the boundaries of the program.  We will need to have a simple start screen and end screen before we are giving graphics for it.  Along with this
    there is a limit to the number of objects that can be generated.  Handle the number, blitz it to screen, and end the game and display final score.
